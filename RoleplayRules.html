General Rules
1.1 Communication
This is a Roleplay Server. This means you MUST be able to communicate with other individuals through voice. Failure to do so is considered Fail RP. If you wish to play as a mute character you must contact staff first to get approval for this type of playstyle.  If you plan on going AFK and you are not at your base to do so then please use the Lie Down (Sleep) Emote.

Now keep in mind If you are killed by a zed while in this state, or you starve to death you will not be comped for anything you've lost. Going into the sleep emote should be done in order to reduce the chance of confusion if another player is trying to RP with you. However it is their right to wait around for you to return if they wish to become hostile. 

If you are using external discord channels you will need to deafen and use the in game voice when you are in a Roleplay Situation. You are allowed to use the in game chat to Roleplay Certain Situations that will increase the level of Roleplay.

::Examples below:: 
*Sam has a frown on his face.*
*Sam ties the man's hands with rope, doing it tightly so they can't wiggle free.* 
*Sam carves a K into the man's cheek just below his left eye.*


1.2 Discord Rules
We understand that people will be using other discords besides our own to communicate. We only ask that if you wish to do this you hot mic so that way people around you can hear you in game as well. For instance, if you are planning on robbing someone you are following and you are making up the plan as you go, hot miking will allow them the chance to react if they overhear you. To do this you must have a working radio on your person at all times. 
If You are being robbed or taken hostage and your radio is taken you may no longer communicate with your friend.  If you're unconned or killed the same rules apply. 
You may bring up old roleplay experiences from previous servers, and mention their server name, however you may not talk bad on said servers, or any server for that matter.


1.3 Standards of Roleplay
While playing on this server, you must remain in character. If you are having technical issues, then you can warn the others in the game while remaining in character. We understand everyone has slip-ups but please try and remain In-Character as much as possible. 

::Examples below:: 
If you are having Lag in the game. " I am suffering from a headache." 
If you are trying to refer to a rule say , “ Laws of the Land”
If you are waiting for Admins in any way say, “I am currently waiting on The Nobody's.” (THIS IS THE HIDDEN PHRASE)
We all understand sometimes OOC shit happens, if a situation due to a real-life emergency comes up. Let the parties involved in the scenario know. It is up to you how much information you give them but allow them to know you are stepping away at least. For this, utilize the chat function and start your message with OOC : Or // then put in your message. 


::Example::
-OOC: AFK 3 minutes 
-// Is it ok if I go AFK for 5 Minutes? 


Soundboards are Allowed here, however Please be realistic about it use it to enhance your rp. IF you wish to run a radio station then you may use this to play music as long as it doesn't go past our date in which stuff started. 
As this is a Roleplay Server, We expect a decent quality of RP to be maintained at all times. If something is impossible to do within the scope of RP, and the mechanics of DayZ; then you cannot conduct the rp. 

Some Scenes may make some people uncomfortable, if they state such in the OOC channel please tailor your actions or what you are doing to make them more comfortable with what is happening. However if we noticed a pattern with the person doing this to get out of something happening to their char *like being captured.* You will be spoken to. We want you to have fun, but a part of that fun is the fear factor you may get. 


1.4 Character Creation
When creating your character, you are not allowed to use a troll name, nor are you allowed to use the name of a famous/fictional person. When creating your character, it is important that you understand the road in which you want to take. Once you have your character created, you cannot step outside of those boundaries in which you have created for your character. 

::Example:: 
If you are roleplaying a Passive Character, then you cannot dip in and out with robberies and or base raids. 
If you are creating a Military, Or Ex-Military Character, you MUST have a good Out OF Character understanding on how they should act or behave, and must act in a similar way IN Character. 
Please try and create a unique and interesting character. Military backgrounds are done often and without the correct knowledge and behavior, this could be considered as Fail Roleplay. 

*Characters that Must have approval via Ticket*
Silent Characters/ Mutes
If you are going to play as a mute you must understand that you will ALWAYS be mute. When you choose to play one, you are committing to the extra effort it takes to do this well as putting your character to a disadvantage.
You Must find ways to realistically communicate. You Cannot write full essays in the dirt, as this is completely unrealistic. You should also not expect that every character can understand sign language. Especially since there are many different sign languages. 

Characters under the age of 18
These characters would have been, at most; 16 years old at the outbreak.
Find a way to confirm your age with players as soon as possible so they are aware they are dealing with a minor as all character models are adults.


1.5 Racism / Hate Speech / Homophobia
Within Roleplay, being a character that would for some reason be a racist character, is not allowed. This means that you are not allowed to roleplay a character that could be; a White Supremacist, Apart of the KKK, anti-sematic or potentially belong to any other group that hates on a race. With this, it is also against the rules to hate-speech of any type in game. This includes specific derogatory terms that would insult somebody based on their origin, skin color, gender, or sexual orientation ect. If Actions against you are taken in game with another player due to these things don't cry about it. Action will also be taken against you OOC if a ticket is made about it. 


1.6 ERP
This is allowed on this server, we are all adults. ERP can enhance someone's rp and push them deeper into the story. This being said BE respectful, I dont want to see you fucking like rabbits in someones front lawn. 
Be respectful of your surroundings and who may be around. If you’re pulled into a ticket you will be notified.
This is to be consensual, if it is not staff will be notified, and you will be faced with punishment.
To play it safe, keep ERP interactions in private discord messages. (Recommended)


1.7 Loopholes
IT is against our rules to intentionally abuse loopholes within our rule set. IF you are caught doing this, then you could face punishment. 


1.8 Roleplay Over Ruleplay
Ruleplay is when you use certain rules within situations to gain an advantage over other players. 

::Examples::
You are robbing someone that isn't complying, but they pose no threat to you. In this situation you shouldn't just shoot the player and instead give them more time to comply with your demands; or tie them up. KILLING should be your Last resort. 
You are a hostile group with the intent to go out and rob others, listed in our rules as initiator 2:1 ratio. This means if you come up on 1 player, 2 of your members may engage. If the situation goes hostile you may use ONLY up to 8 people to defend yourselves. If you are walking with more than 8 people you are PREPLAN who is involved.
1.9 Combat Logging
Combat logging is defined as intentionally disconnecting from the server during an ongoing combat situation to avoid roleplay consequences or in-character injuries.
Combat logging is strictly prohibited on this roleplay server.
Players must remain in the server and actively participate in the roleplay scenario until the combat situation has concluded and 15 minutes have passed. If a player experiences technical issues that result in disconnection during combat, they must promptly inform the involved parties and staff about the issue.
In cases of accidental disconnection or technical issues, players should make every effort to rejoin the roleplay server and resume the scenario as soon as possible.
KOS Zones you are not to logout within a KOS zone boundary, or within 100 meters of the border, if you are found to be doing so you will receive punishment from staff.



Roleplay Rules
2.1 Valuing Your Life
When Roleplaying you must ensure that you value your character's life at all times. Your best thought process is would you do this if you were in their shoes? If you have a weapon pointed at your head, then you must wait for an opportunity that allows you to Escape OR Retaliate, this needs to always stick in the back of your mind. IF you retaliate make sure that you are willing to deal with the aftermath. DO NOT INSTANTLY TURN AND SHOOT. If your character is killed and you didn’t take "Value Of Life '' Into consideration, then you may be subject to a character kill. Which is "Permanent"


2.2 New Life Rules
IF you are "wounded" (killed) by another player, then you must forget all the events that led up to your death. The person who killed you (wounded you) May remember, but please remember no trolling or gloating to the person, saying " hey I killed you yesterday how's your head" they obviously won't remember. However if there were several of your group there, your group can easily fill you in on what happened upon meeting them in character. IF they were there and survived. IF this happens you are more then welcome to act out a revenge upon someone. 
Once you are killed by another player, you are not allowed to return to the general location in which the encounter took place for at least 30 minutes and all events leading up to and after the interaction has ended. IF you are killed by an environmental factor, or a KoS (needs to be approved by staff) then this is void and you may return. 


2.3 Fail Roleplay
Fail Roleplay or FRP is defined as when a person fails to roleplay properly, whether that be through going down an unrealistic RP Lore, or intentionally disrupting the roleplay of other’s by trolling.

::Examples::
You bring a character in that is a “wizard” it doesn’t pertain to our Lore, so it would be FRP/Fail Roleplay


2.4 Meta Gaming & Stream Sniping
*Meta Gaming*
Meta gaming is when a player uses information that they have obtained OOCly, and they use it ICly. Now we are not stupid, everyone meta games to some degree, but please try to refrain from doing it. We understand there may be slip ups, bring it to staff attention to be squashed immediately. Meta includes but does not limit to the following.
Passing on information that your previous characters obtained to your new character.
Gaining any knowledge from AN OUT OF GAME SOURCE. (Stream Sniping / Discord)
Using Information from the Discord outside of the designated IC channels within our official discord.
You have OOC "Drama" with another player, so you take that in-game. Remember, Players are separate from their characters, and their IC Actions should not in any way reflect on OOC Feelings.


*Stream Sniping*
Stream Sniping occurs when you have a player's stream open and use the information you see there, whether to find, harass, or spy on them, or otherwise interact when you have no direct RP reason to do so. This is NOT allowed Whatsoever. 
YOU MAY NOT WATCH ANY STREAM WHILE YOU ARE IN THE SERVER, if caught it will result in not 1, but 2 levels of punishment.

::Example::
You watch Player A rob Player B on a twitch stream, then log on to tell Player C who the culprit is. your character was not there during the event and would have no way of knowing that information.



2.5 Fear Roleplay
Fear roleplay, often abbreviated as "FearRP,"  involves simulating and enforcing a character's realistic emotional response to dangerous or life-threatening situations in the game. FearRP serves to maintain realism and immersion during roleplay by requiring characters to respond believably when confronted with threats, violence, or situations that would logically induce fear or panic. 


Here's how FearRP typically works:
Immersion: 
To maintain the integrity of the roleplay world, players are expected to fully immerse themselves in their character's persona and emotions. This means that, when faced with a dangerous situation, the player should act as if they were truly in their character's shoes, experiencing fear, anxiety, and vulnerability.

Realistic Response: 
Players should respond realistically to threats, even if their character is typically brave or tough. This means that in a situation where their character's life is in danger, they should not take unnecessary risks, refuse to comply with armed assailants, or act in a way that defies common sense. Instead, they should display fear, submit to threats, and prioritize self-preservation.

Consequences:  
Violating FearRP can have consequences, such as character injury, imprisonment, or even character death. These consequences are intended to ensure that roleplay remains immersive and consistent.

Balanced Roleplay: 
It's important to strike a balance between roleplaying fear and maintaining interesting, dynamic storytelling. Players should aim to provide engaging roleplay experiences while adhering to the principles of FearRP.

::Here's an example of FearRP in action::
Imagine a scenario where a character is held at gunpoint by another character during a roleplay encounter. If the character being threatened acts bravely or defiantly, it may break the immersion and realism of the situation. Instead, in FearRP, the character being held at gunpoint should realistically respond with fear, follow the instructions of the armed character, and prioritize their own safety.

FearRP serves to create more engaging and emotionally charged roleplay experiences, making interactions more dynamic and authentic within the context of the roleplay world. It encourages players to embrace their character's emotions and make decisions based on those emotions, ultimately contributing to a more immersive and enjoyable roleplaying environment.




2.6 Character Death/Kill (CK/Perma Death)
IF you are attempting to Character Kill another player, you must FIRST contact staff to see if the reasoning behind it is valid. And no it can't be because you dislike how someone sounds or dresses. You need to have multiple interactions with this person, or persons to make it valid. This may require evidence. In order for a character kill to be valid, it must be done by execution with witnesses (NOT a Gunfight) with extensive RP beforehand. 
	Character Death/Kill (CK/Perma Death) requires staff intervention and a ticket to be open within the discord involving the individuals wishing to kill said character off. When the execution of the player death/kill takes place staff will be required to watch, and will pull the “Victim” into a ticket to inform them their character has been killed. 
If you have been character killed, you would now be involved in a staff ticket, tensions may be high, so in this case that staff ticket will be your emotional bubble for 24 hours. After the 24 hour phase you may enter a new Character backstory into said ticket and Lore Team will have to approve your character, You will not be able to join the server for 24 hours.
Once a CK ticket is accepted and validated by Staff there will be a notification with time stamps TYPED OUT on how long the CK order will be in effect.
Should you choose to willingly not value your life in a hostile situation, you may be subject to a character kill at the judgment of staff


2.7 Power Gaming
Power gaming is using everything that you can to have your will/way to win the situation. This can be done through extending the powers of your character beyond what is possible for your character within RP. Any form of power gaming is strictly forbidden. This also includes forcing a character to do an action that they may not like, or can’t physically do. We prefer you to ask in //ooc on if they’re or their character is within the boundaries of doing so.
Staff intervention will be heavily enforced for this topic, if you feel you’ve asked someone in //ooc to do something, and they instantly say no, but it’s something that has been intended, or planned, staff will need to be involved.


2.8 Glitching & Duping & Hacking
Abusing the game mechanics to glitch, dupe, or hack is strictly forbidden within the community. We understand that players will come across a form of glitch, or dupe within the intention of abusing it, but if you fail to report it to a member of staff after using it then you will be dealt with accordingly. This includes, but does not limit to, glitching into bases, glitching, killing a player or using any form of hacks. 
Open a Game Support ticket with any Duping/Glitching issues.
Exploiting the Skill System in any way will result in punishment from staff




2.9 In Character Channels (Discord)
To use the IC radio channel on our discord server, you must have on your character a functional radio, or PDA (channel dependent), which is powered with a working battery. The only things that should ever be sent over these channels should be things which can be heard (radio), or be read (pda). Morse code styles of communication are acceptable. IF you breach any of these rules you may face punishment as well as a strike. If you receive three strikes you will permanently lose permissions to use the IC radio channel. 


*Spamming IC Communication Channels*
Do not spam the IC communication channels, they are in place for players to conduct immersive roleplay. Radio communications are to be short and simple, however PDA communications as they are a readable message may be longer, IF you are advertising, and only IF you are advertising some sort of trade / group roleplay instance (PDA).


*Other IC Communication Channel Rules*
You cannot initiate over the IC Channels, threaten all you want, but nothing will come of it until it's done in character and role played out correctly to rule standards.
Your character is always able to “HEAR” the radio (If they have a functional radio), it is to be referred to as a “Radio Broadcast” in character to avoid accidental mis interpretations.
All information over the IC communication channels CAN be used In character, so may wanna watch what you say.



3. Base Building / Raiding
3.1 General Base Rules
You are allowed to build anywhere, except for the following areas:
KOS zones
High Tier Loot Zones (Within 800 meters of an area that spawns a high frequency of loot and military outposts /buildings. Unless approved by staff.)
Main Roads 
Hospitals/Police stations (Unless approved by staff.)
Each group may only have 1 MAIN base, and 1 Outpost.

If you would like to build in a certain area for RP purposes, but this rule prohibits that, then staff may approve it. You will need to contact a staff team member and request a meeting to get it approved via a Lore Ticket. 




Do not build unrealistic bases.
The base must be relative to the size of your group, or expansion needs to be requested by staff (Possible Prefabs to come from Faction/Settlement Roleplay)
No fucking sky / floating bases THIS IS NOT FORTNITE
Anything built in BBP blueprints must be realistic to 1. The terrain, and 2. General architecture


::: What Classifies As a Base?:::
A base is an area in which a player has tried to block off access. Whether it is a section of land that has been walled off, built upon, or a house which has been blocked off and barricaded. 

::: Base Building Limitations::: 
IF you are building around a MAP MARKED water pump, the access to that pump needs to remain accessible at all times. You may wall around it, or close it in, but you may not lock doors to that said pump. People must be able to freely get to it at all times. 


3.2 Player Made RoadBlocks
Player-made RoadBlocks are allowed for short periods of time. Or Longer if they obtain staff permission. If a Roadblock is in place for more than 24 hours, without the staff team's approval it will be removed. 
Whilst the RoadBlock is in place it should always have a player operating it (Letting people pass through) If there is no player operating it, it must be adjusted to allow clear passage. A gate WITHOUT a lock is seen as a clear passage. 


3.3 Base Raiding Rules
You must obtain staff permission, via a HARD RAID TICKET. (Hard Raid).
You must have a valid RP reason to Raid.
You must gather intel on a group before you initiate a raid.
You can not raid the same person/group for up to 7 days.
You can only use two people while stacking.
You can not use a vehicle to gain entry into a base.
You can not use a placed/buildable item to gain entry into a base.
No offline raiding AT ALL (Defenders must have 3 active people around)
There is a two hour raid limit, once commenced, which also means New Life Rule for this Instance for the both sides may not return for two hours.
Once the “Raiders” have left the area (500 Meters) they may not return to that general area for 6 hours. (Exceptions made in Ticket)
A raid must have a clear initiation, if you’re raiding you must give roleplay to the Defenders, and the Defenders a chance to Surrender and open doors.
RAIDERS MUST BE RECORDING AT ALL TIMES ALL POV’S ARE REQUIRED IN CASE A TICKET IS MADE (ALL RAIDS) RECORDINGS ARE TO BE HELD FOR UP TO A WEEK.
If you have people in your group who cannot record, they may not participate in direct raids, but they can provide security / numbers for gunplay if it comes to it.
Insiding is considered a Hard Raid, you must open a ticket to get approved for any insiding you want to do. (Inisiding is when you are “part” of a faction, and you raid everyone within your group's stuff with another faction.)


3.4 Base Raiding (Hard Raid)
	A Hard raid is considered destroying walls, moving or placing objects, or gaining access through a manor in which you may not have without placing an object to gain entry. In order to do a hard raid you must open a ticket and fill out the fields provided to be approved. If you are found hard raiding with no permission for staff, punishment will be determined for the instance.
At no time if someone gives you “permission” to dismantle items within a base, means you can. YOU ARE TO OPEN A TICKET FOR A HARD TICKET.


3.5 Base Raiding (Soft Raid)
	Soft raiding is allowed. Soft raiding is considered finding a weak point in someone’s base that you can jump into, or stack into. Object placement is against soft raid policy and will result in a punishment. A soft raid is when you clear any storage, but leave that storage. Soft raiding is permitted only if you’re not placing an object to enter/exit a base.
If a door is left open, you may enter however you will probably be shot, as you’ve now entered someone’s home and KOS is now in effect on the HOMEOWNERS END.
You may not pick up any storage, or place objects during a soft raid.
You may only take what you can carry on your person


3.6 Base Raiding (Griefing)
	Base Griefing is when you steal placed objects, or flags from a base, this is a punishable offense, unless you have a HARD RAID TICKET in and it’s been approved. Dropping items on the ground, placing explosives, or a trap outside a base is against our rules. If you are accepted for a HARD RAID TICKET, you may take storage, HOWEVER  you must move what you do not wish to take into another storage to avoid Griefing. Placing Codelocks / Locks / or anything to gain or disrupt someone’s base, or building within a flag protected zone that you should not be building in is considered griefing.
	Breaking unnecessary base items, only break what you need to to gain access to rooms you’re looking at raiding 
You may not steal or mess with any territory flags. 
You may take a flag and REPLACE the flag, and then RAISE it all the way up if the flag is “accessible” (By soft raid Methods only).



4. Rules of Engagement
Initiation means that you have initiated a fight with a person or a group. To have a proper invitation you will need to give them a Clear verbal threat whilst also giving them your demands. Follow the rules below. 

4.1 Initiation
Initiation means that you have initiated a fight with a person or a group.  To have a proper initiation you will need to give them a clear verbal threat whilst also giving them your demands. These must be clear and easy to understand, and you will need to give the person enough time to carry them out. These threats and demands must also be conveyed in a threatening or hostile manner. *Weapons raised and aggressive tone of voice.* 
You also will need to make sure that the person actually heard your demands before you start any fighting. If a member of your group has been initiated upon, then you are allowed to assist them by opening fire on the players involved. In order to do this, you must be wearing an armband, or a matching group uniform that clearly signifies that your group is together. 
Likewise, if you are within the party which is performing the robbery or hostile act, your group will need to be wearing the same armband or uniform. This removes any confusion that may occur during a fight. IF a gun fight ensues , then it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not harm a player that is not involved. However if an outside person involves themselves that is not a part of either side then its fair game. 
You are NOT allowed to remove armbands or swap them out to confuse players during an interaction or for at least 40 minutes after said interaction. 


4.2 Random Death Match / Vehicular Death Match
Random Deathmatch is shooting someone without proper initiation. If you shoot or attack someone without prior initiation you will be guilty of RDM, and admin action may be taken.


4.3 Hostile RP
For hostile intent you must interact with the person for 1:30-2 minutes prior to starting any robbery or hostile rp, this is set to ensure roleplay is genuine, and hint at any hostile interaction that may take place within the scenario. If the individual is attempting to avoid roleplay, you may commence hostile roleplay. (Please keep video of the interaction in case you’re pulled into a ticket for up to 7 days.)
When holding someone up you must give them 10 seconds to comply before resorting to the next actions. Remember KILLING should be a LAST resort.
Before both parties of a hostile Situation, the Victim and the Aggressor; there must be quality interactive Roleplay. For the Victim, act how your character would, but prioritize the value of your life. For the Aggressor, value the life of your victim and provide high-quality HostileRP.
Putting someone on the "You Are Dead" screen should be an absolute last resort for RP.  
When you rush to kill someone it doesn't push the story compared to being creative and working out other ways to get your point across for being hostile or upset with someone. IF there is any confusion in a Hostile situation or content you would like to be toned down, please use the "// OOC '' chat to communicate this. Remember Communication is important and Key to the survival of RP. 
The only time the aggressor may fire their weapon and kill the victim is if the victim poses a direct threat to you, or your party, or outright refuses to comply within a reasonable amount of time, or after a reasonable amount of threats. A direct threat is situations such as; Shooting back, being hit or slashed at with a melee weapon or throwing explosives. 


Please remember to follow the following rules as well. 
If we find a group is doing a constant " Just Kill Them" Rp, punishments will be handed out. We are an RP server RP out ever seen to the best and fullest ability that you can.
 * Hands Up * rp IS NOT allowed. You can not run up to someone and say ,  " Hands , hands , hands'' Or " Hands Up or Die." Interaction with the person beforehand is a must. Interaction Over the Radio does not count as Interaction, the Interaction with the person Must be Face to Face.
You as the Victim only gains Kill rights when you are initiated upon. But remember to value your life, don't be trying to shoot your way out of things if you're surrounded by six people. The most one person can do or should do is 1v2, depending on their weapons and gear as well. (This is null and void if the group has more players in the background. Value your life.) 
When robbing someone you must value the life and survival of your victim(s). As the aggressor, you must assure that your victim(s) have the minimum requirements to survive. If they don't have it you must provide it.
Leave the following items on your victim for quality roleplay: (If they have the items)
Clothes (Unless traded for something you want 1on1)
A Knife
Matches
Basic Medical Supplies (Give it to them if they don’t have it, if you have extra)
Food & Water (Give it to them if they don’t have it, regardless if you have extra)
Anything they may need to survive harsh winter.
If you are the victim. you MUST comply with the demands of the Aggressor. IF you fail to comply within a reasonable amount of time or after multiple requests and demands, you are subject to be killed by the aggressors. 
There is a 35 minute timer in which you are allowed to hold someone up unless otherwise consent is given through OOC to continue the rp for as long as it's needed.
There is a 2 hour timer for retaliation in which the victims can take action against aggressors. This timer only starts once both parties have broken full and complete eye contact with each other. (During this 2 hour timer, the 1:30-2 minute rule for hostile interaction is invalid, however you must still make an effort to roleplay.)
Once hostile interactions have finished and eye contact has been broken between both parties. *Meaning you can no longer see each other.* You are not allowed to log out for at least 15 minutes. If you do this will be considered combat logging and you will be spoken to. If you feel you may need to log out then please do not participate in the hostile interaction. 
Friendly parties of the hostage must also value all lives involved. If someone you’re roleplaying with is in trouble, and you can confirm they are in trouble you may act, however if you are outnumbered, or stand a chance of getting that person killed you may not react.
As a cannibal you may skin people, however keep killing them to a minimum unless roleplay reveals a reason to kill them, keep gunplay/death screen to a last resort.

::Example::
If your friend has been taken hostage, you still must have adequate rp initiation before taking any shots. Sniping on any parties when you are not actively involved in the scene will be considered RDM and can be punishable.

Communications with your friends and outside parties Are revoked once your radio is removed from your person. (Directed at Discord Rules)


4.4 Hostage RP
Taking a hostage is a great way to gain leverage over an opposing group. A hostage has to value their lives and comply with their hostage taker unless they demand actions that are impossible to perform. 
When attempting to rescue a hostage you must ensure that the hostage's safety is your priority. As a hostage taker, you must value your hostage's life. This means you must ensure that the hostage is given food, water, and protected against environmental factors. 
There is a 35 minute timer in which you are allowed to hold your hostage unless otherwise asked for more time and allotted more time in the OOC Chat. If they do not agree to more time then you must release them. The ONLY exception to this rule is that negotiations are ongoing and the opposite side is close to the hostage.


4.5 Torture & Extreme Actions
TortureRP and other extreme types of RP Is ALLOWED. This means darker themes, and can at times make a player uncomfortable. If you as either the victim or the aggressor feel uncomfortable with the rp, please use the "//OOC" chat to communicate it.
The torture, IF you are torturing someone, you do Not need to gain permission through OOC if you are going to leave a small scar. 

::Example::
Cutting a K on someone's cheek. 
Stabbing them in the leg
Cutting flesh off of them.

YOU DO however need to get an OOC person to do the following. Do gain permissions ask them In the OOC "// do i have permission to do heavy torture with you, it may consist of lossing a finger." IF you as the victim do not mention in the OOC chat that you are uncomfortable, but continue with the tortureRP and give them permission to continue; then you must live with bearing that scar or mission appendage. It can not be retconned.

4.6 Kos Rules & Zones
	This is a roleplay server, however PVP is allowed. With this being said, Roleplay comes first. We wish for a good roleplay experience on the server and there are PVP zones clarified.
PVP zones are Parris Island, and Area 42. A PVP zone is classified as a “LITTLE TO NO RP ZONE” meaning RP is not required. These PVP zones will be marked by (TBA)
If you walk into a PVP Area which will be marked on the map, no rp is needed; it's every man or person for themselves. If you get ambushed and die, deal with it. If you dont wanna die or have a chance to die, don't go into those areas. Going into these areas you agree that you may be shot and killed without any prior verbal interaction. If you do not wish to fight anyone in this manner stay out of these areas. 
If you die in a PVP zone you will not be comped. 
If you die in a PVP zone you follow the New Life Rule, you don’t remember even going to the pvp zone.

Other things to know 

Sub Factions
Sub factions are allowed, however they must consist of five different members then the main faction that they are a part of. Subfactions are entitled to a custom armband and flag as well, just like any other faction if they have five or more members; which are not a part of the main faction. Sub factions are however not entitled to having extra buildings placed. 


Faction Strikes 
Keep in mind this rule is put in place to help factions keep their members under control. If any member of a faction receives a warning or punishment for breaking any of the rules on the server, then the faction is subject to receiving a faction strike. This is up to the staff's discretion whether or not the faction gets a strike or not. When a faction gets three strikes then that said faction will no longer be able to claim any of their perks. 

However faction strikes will be removed after two months if no further rule breaks happen within that time. These strikes can also be appealed like any other ban. When appealing a faction strike you must outline what you are changing and how you are working towards preventing further rule breaks from your faction.

7. Loot Cycling
7.1 Definition of Loot Cycling
	Loot cycling is when you pick up, throw, or pick up and log out, an item from which it has spawned in order to “exploit” the loot cycle, and gain better loot. Any way of throwing items out and waiting on the new cycle to come through is a punishable offense.

::Examples::
Placing a storage and putting all the “trash” in it, then logging out or leaving the zone and coming back shortly after.
Picking up an item relogging, and picking up the next item that spawns
Picking up and throwing an item then leaving the area, or relogging to gain a better spawn chance.
Burning “trash” items to gain better loot in the area you are in
Using a trash can to delete items to gain better loot in the area you are in
Logging off to recycle loot, and gain an advantage of the loot system.



8. Loot Hoarding
Disclaimer: This is a STRONG recommendation as DayZ does DayZ things. :)

8.1 Storage limit
	We ask that you keep a realistic storage limit per base, you may decide how it works, however if the area around/in your base becomes a complete LAG PIT, staff will step in.

::Examples:: 
(THESE ARE NOT HARD SET RULES, JUST RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE MOMENT)
2 Lockers Per Person
1 Fridge Per Person
1 Of Each “Work/Building” bench per faction/group/settlement/solo/duo.
Keep Aesthetics overall per building to 6, this being plants, furniture, lights, etc.


8.2 Necessary Items
	We ask that you keep NECESSARY items that you would need for the “apocalypse” (meaning don’t stack and stack and stack). This will limit lag, and will help with server performance long term storage wise.



9. Gear Fear
9.1 Definition of Gear Fear
What is Gear Fear? Gear Fear is when you leave all your items behind at base hidden away because you don’t want to lose said items in an altercation. 

::Examples::
You have the #1 BEST GUN on the entire DEER ISLE MAP, and you hide it away.
You have a “rare” clothing set and you hide it away, unless you’re using/saving it for a sale


9.2 General Gear Fear
	Basically what we’re asking is that you don’t hide anything away due to it being a “rare” or uncommon spawn. Have fun, roleplay, don’t hide your valued gear, show it off. As for KOS zones, this rule applies. You may not enter a KOS Zone without gear.



10. Roleplay > Gunplay

10.1 Definition of Roleplay > Gunplay
	Roleplay is TOP priority, not saying Gunplay isn’t fun, but please keep in mind this is a roleplay server. Roleplay should always be #1, gunplay should be a last resort.

::Examples::
Gunplay is essentially when you are a trigger happy PVPer. :) (Don’t be a Trigger happy PVPer here, #ROLEPLAY)
