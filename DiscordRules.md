# Purgatory Roleplay Discord Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Communication

- 1.1 Using Discord to chat

    - Please read through Discord’s™ TOS to familiarize yourself with the basics of conducting and using the software.
    You are not permitted to utilize any of the OOC avenues to intimidate, harass, bully, spam, or solicit in any way shape or form. 
    This is not limited to what is specifically stated and will be handled on a case to case basis if called for. Respect your peers.
    All communication should be within the server in its designated channel.
    Do NOT message players privately unless you have permission from the player
    OOC should be kept in OOC, IC should be kept IC.

- 1.2 Advertisements

    - If you want to advertise yourself, friends, streams, etc., you must gain permission to do so.
    If you want to promote an approved DayZ™ server, you must gain permission to do so.
    ANY NSFW advertisement MUST be approved and marked as “spoiler” before being posted within the correct channel - not everyone consents to seeing such content.
    All advertisement postings are subject to the scrutiny and judgment of Purgatory staff.


- 1.3 OOC VS. IC

    - OOC channels means that ALL of the information provided can NOT be used IC.
    All of the IC channels may be used for “IC knowledge” so be careful what you post.
    The “IC PDA Communication” channel is for people who have a PDA IC and need to communicate to other players. The information provided is considered IC knowledge to anyone who reads it.
    We are working on implementing new ways of encrypted radio transmissions.
    If you are found to be using OOC information while IC (refer to “meta gaming” in the server rules), you will be pulled into a ticket for the proper actions laid out for meta gaming in our server rules.
    You are responsible for maintaining the difference between yourself and your character(s). 
    Retaliating against players OOC because of an IC transgression will not be tolerated.
    Bringing IC issues OOC will not be tolerated.
    Keep your OOC and IC separate.


## 2. Ticket Creation, Use & Purpose

- 2.1 Ticket Usage
    - Tickets are meant to be utilized for communication between staff and players.
    If you have any questions about mechanics, ideas, lore, issues, please put in a ticket. 
    Do not spam the ticket system. If you already have an active ticket and have questions about a different topic, bring it up in your current ticket with staff and they will inform you if you need to open a different ticket or  not.

- 2.2 Ticket Retrieval 

    - If you need an archived ticket from a previous incident, request it via a ticket. As long as the ticket does not violate other people’s privacy, we will do our best to obtain a copy of the ticket for you. 
    Archived tickets MUST have been opened by you in order to obtain records or copies of said ticket.

- 2.3 Ticket Privacy

    - All tickets are considered private.
    You are not permitted to inquire about other people’s tickets. We will not share their information with you or anyone else outside of the ticket.
    If you are invited into a ticket, you are NOT to share the information inside of the ticket with anyone. 
    If you are invited/brought into a ticket, you are NOT the ticket creator and are not permitted to ask for the archived information.
    If you are found to be sharing private information you will be addressed via staff and dealt with via protocol. 

## 3. Chatting 

- 3.1 Basic Conduct

    - You are expected to remain polite, receptive, and mannered during your time in the server at all times. 
    “Read the room” is a useful tool for anyone and everyone. Do your best to contribute to the conversation at hand. It’s never a good time when someone comes barreling in with something completely unrelated. Try to respect those around you and look for an appropriate time to change topics.
    There will be ZERO tolerance for racism, sexism, hate-speech, slave-speech, anti-LGBTQ+ speech, and anything else that may be considered part of “hate speech”. This is a safe place, it is your responsibility to uphold this.
    Out-of-Character Drama: The importation or exportation of out-of-character disputes associated with past or present servers is unacceptable within the confines of Purgatory.

- 3.2 Comfort Zone

    - If something is making you uncomfortable, you have the right to either address the person(s) involved with the conversation - or reach out to staff for assistance. The third option is to remove yourself from the situation altogether.  
    Staff can not police every single situation that makes someone uncomfortable. We will always do our due diligence to assist when possible. Your best form of action will always be a ticket for a member of staff to look over (and it helps you keep things documented).
    If you want to report someone for going into your DM’s and bringing anything that falls beneath the 3.1 Basic Conduct section, you are able to open a ticket and provide screen shots of the conversation pertaining to the breach of comfort/safety. 
    Screenshots are going to be valuable if Staff decides we need to take corrective action. 

- 3.3 Alternate Server Communication

    - Permitted: Participants may reference roleplay experiences from prior servers, identifying the server name by which it was known.
    Prohibited: Disparaging commentary regarding aforementioned servers is strictly forbidden. While allusions to negative situations are allowed, the overall tone must remain neutral or positive.
